# Technologies Used
1. React JS
2. React Router
3. Material UI

# Approach taken
High Level Scope:
1. React JS App was created
2. Components within the app to render pages and subpages of the website were created
3. Using react router, the components were linked together

Hand Ranking Game:
1. Data file for hand combinations created. This was an array of objects representing poker hands. Each hand had a name, id, and ranking value assigned to it.
2. Created a component to render the widget for one hand.
3. Created a component to map all the hands using the component in (2.) and the data file. This component renders all the hand widgets.
4.

# Installation instructions

# Unsolved Problems
1. The hand ranking game currently does not allow the user to reshuffle the widgets once selected in the drop area, they must drag it back to the initial list section and redrag in the desired order.
2. Once the modal is open, you can still scroll on the screen that it is overlaying.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
