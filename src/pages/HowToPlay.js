                <h2>Learn How to Play Poker</h2>
                <p>Learning to play poker is not as daunting as it may seem. Whether you are a beginner or a poker veteran looking for a refresher, here's what you need to know to play Texas Hold'em.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="objective">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The objective is to win the "pot" out of a group of players. Now listen close, this is the fun part: we don't necessarily need the best hand to win.</p>
                <p>
                    Typically, the winner of each hand of poker is the player that holds the highest ranked hand when all cards are shown at the end of the hand –known as the ‘showdown’ – or the player that makes the last uncalled bet, thus winning without needing to reach a showdown.

                <h2>Basic Poker Rules</h2>
                <h4>Starting the Game</h4>
                <p>Poker games typically feature a forced bet called the Big Blind and Small Blind. These forced bets comprise the starting pot in any given hand of poker, which is the first incentive players have to win the hand. Action arising from the subsequent rounds of betting further increases the size of the pot.</p>

                <h4>Dealing Cards and Placing Bets</h4>
                <div>
                    After any initial cards are dealt, players are usually called upon to act in turn, moving clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>

                    Each player can usually take one of the following actions when it is their turn to act:<br/><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Check – To check is to decline the opportunity to open the betting. Players can only check when there is no bet during the current round, and the act of checking passes the action clockwise to the next person in the hand. If all active players check, those players remain in the hand and the round is considered complete.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li> 
                            Bet – Players may bet if no other players have bet during the current round. Once a bet has been made, other players must ‘call’ by matching the amount bet, in order to remain in the hand.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            Fold – Players who fold forfeit their cards and cannot win or act again during the current hand.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            Call – Players can call if other players have bet during the current round; this requires the calling player to match the highest bet made.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            Raise – Players may raise if other players have bet during the current round; this requires the raising player to match the highest bet made, and then make a greater one. All subsequent players are required to call the raise or raise again (‘re-raise’) to stay in the hand.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    There are four rounds of betting known as pre-flop, the flop, the turn and the river.<br/><br/>

                    The pre-flop betting round begins as soon as all players have received their hole cards, before any community cards have been dealt; betting on the flop occurs after the first three community cards are dealt; on the turn after the fourth community card; and on the river after the fifth and final community card.<br/><br/>

                    On each betting round, betting continues until every player has either matched the bets made or folded (if no bets are made, the round is complete when every player has checked). When the betting round is completed, the next dealing/betting round begins, or the hand is complete.
